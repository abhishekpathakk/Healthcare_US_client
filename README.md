Healthcare DLT Pipeline - US Client


This Delta Live Table (DLT) pipeline processes healthcare data in real-time, transforming raw patient and diagnosis data from the Bronze layer into actionable insights in the Silver and Gold layers. The pipeline consists of multiple stages: it begins by creating two Bronze tables, diagnostic_mapping, which stores raw diagnosis mapping data from default1.raw_diagnosis_map, and daily_patients, which captures streaming patient data from default1.raw_patients_daily. Next, a Silver table, processed_patient_data, is created by joining patient data with diagnosis descriptions from the Bronze tables. Data quality constraints ensure that rows with missing values for key fields like patient_id, name, age, and contact_number are dropped. Finally, two Gold tables are generated for analytics: patient_statistics_by_diagnosis, which aggregates patient data based on diagnosis description, and patient_statistics_by_gender, which provides statistics based on patient gender. The pipeline ensures continuous, high-quality data processing, applying real-time data transformations to provide insightful healthcare data analytics. Inputs to the pipeline are default1.raw_diagnosis_map and default1.raw_patients_daily, and the key outputs are refined data in processed_patient_data and aggregated statistics in patient_statistics_by_diagnosis and patient_statistics_by_gender.
